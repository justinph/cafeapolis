<p>Now that the weather is acceptable for sitting outside, my mind, and apparently everyone else&#8217;s, turns to finding fabulous outdoor seating whenever I go out. How can we not thirst for sun after six months of winter? In my neighborhood there are many options but a favorite for casual streetside coffee-sipping might be Gigi&#8217;s Cafe in south Minneapolis.</p>
<p><span id="more-47"></span><br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
<h3>Big Town Main Street</h3>
<div class="shadow"><img src='http://cafeapolis.com/wp-content/2007/05/bigtown.jpg' alt='Big Town Main Street' /></p>
<div class="topleft"></div>
<div class="topright"></div>
<div class="bottomleft"></div>
<div class="bottomright"></div>
</div>
<p>This place is packed almost every time I go, though it&#8217;s not a well-known place like some other cafes I&#8217;ve been too. It doesn&#8217;t have the history of Nina&#8217;s nor the profile power of Spyhouse, but among the neighbors and friends of friends who&#8217;ve discovered this classy little joint it certainly does the trick. It sits among several other neighborhood businesses on the blocks surrounding the corner of 36th Street and Bryant Avenue. Together they resemble a small town main street: hardware store, pet shop, flower shop, convenience store, a matchbox-sized barbershop, and a breakfast joint. Mostly though the area is home to several residential species: 1920&#8217;s bungalows and apartment buildings, elder care facilities, and further west toward Lake Calhoun, still older and larger residences. It is quiet, close to the lake, but just blocks away from the liveliness of Uptown proper. This could explain the diversity of folks stopping into Gigi&#8217;s on any given day.</p>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<h3>Gigi&#8217;s</h3>
<div class="shadow"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cafeapolis/483492711/"><img src='http://cafeapolis.com/wp-content/2007/05/gigsinside.jpg' alt='The cafe itself' /></a></p>
<div class="topleft"></div>
<div class="topright"></div>
<div class="bottomleft"></div>
<div class="bottomright"></div>
</div>
<p>The cafe itself consists of two rooms. The first is the coffee shop part comprised tall tables along the windows and the large kitchen/counter area where young women scurry about grinding coffee and offering plates of food. Fresh flowers and a candle grace each small tabletop. The ceiling is low, the walls are warm wood panelling and fresh avocado. The only decor involves unopened wine bottles and a large hanging rack of sparkling wine glasses waiting for filling. It is understated to the point where it just fades into the background (that being the whole point, as I&#8217;ll get to later). Maybe you could say it has an Italian or French feel but even so, what evidence could you point to? Hard to put a finger on it.</p>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<h3>The Goods</h3>
<div class="shadow"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cafeapolis/483487135/"><img src='http://cafeapolis.com/wp-content/2007/05/gigisbakery.jpg' alt='The Goods' /></a></p>
<div class="topleft"></div>
<div class="topright"></div>
<div class="bottomleft"></div>
<div class="bottomright"></div>
</div>
<p>My favorite part of this room has to be two bright old-fashioned glass bakery displays, one unveiling slices of cake and pie, cobbler, scones and large homemade cookies with a luscious overall effect worthy of a <a href="http://goodonpaper.typepad.com/goodonpaper/images/thiebaud_cakes.jpg">Theibaud</a> painting. The other display showcases gourmet sandwiches, quiche, and cheerful salads ready for a quick lunch or mellow dinner. Of course wine is available, but Gigi&#8217;s is also very much a coffee shop. Good thing because the coffee is fantastic! But if you really want a treat, try the teas. My very gracious server showed me a short but robust list of teas and recommended her favorite (Orange Dulce), which turned out to the best new tea I&#8217;ve tried in awhile. </p>
<p>Not only are the coffee drinks and teas worthy of a write-up, but the food is fantastic. It comes in refreshingly medium-sized portions that are perfect for a lighter meal, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. Burritos, spaghetti, pasta salads, quiche, thick French bread with butter. Many evenings feature specials that include bottles of wine, just made for Date Night. I saw several folks stop in for a bite on their way home from the gym after work. </p>
<p>The second larger room, through a doorway hung with heavy drapes, feels more like a classic cafe. Large, open, filled with small tables, it looks more put-together. A few mirrors and reproductions of Mexican paintings grace the bronze and green walls. Wide windows allow the sun in all day, but the candles on every table make the room soft and mysterious at night. </p>
<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<div class="shadow"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cafeapolis/483451832/"><img src='http://cafeapolis.com/wp-content/2007/05/gigisstreet.jpg' alt='Street Scene' /></a></p>
<div class="topleft"></div>
<div class="topright"></div>
<div class="bottomleft"></div>
<div class="bottomright"></div>
</div>
<p>While the inside atmosphere is pleasant, what attracts the crowds are the amiable patio tables outside on the sidewalk. Thirty-sixth street is busy but not too loud or congested; you can enjoy the energy of the street and still hear yourself think. Here you&#8217;ll find families, friends, bikers, readers, dog-walkers, and neighbors enjoying a glass or wine or a cup of coffee, basking in the high noon sun or the last light of the evening. </p>
<p>Generally you will find a slightly older, more professional crowd at Gigi&#8217;s. There is no wifi offered and after sitting awhile it occurred to me that this was most likely done on purpose. The biggest difference from most coffee shops I&#8217;ve been to is the almost complete lack of students tapping on laptops. One could certainly study here, but only if it involved those old-fashioned dealies known as &#8220;books&#8221;. No wireless and the downplaying of decor lends itself to the experience. Gigi&#8217;s becomes the background upon which more important things happen: enjoying quality food and drink, relaxing and talking with friends, and appreciating a delicious summer evening. </p>

	<li id="comment-3151"><p>I live in the neighborhood and used to go into gigi&#8217;s regularly and have always enjoyed. Recently however I have been really disappointed with the food. I was told they have had a change in the kitchen and baking staff and it shows. Perhaps they will get it right again, but for now I feel there are better options around.</p>

	<li id="comment-3840"><p>Gigi&#8217;s is awful. Not because of the quaint location or the cute, friendly girls that work there, it&#8217;s that they microwave their food! My tamale pie was stuck to it&#8217;s plate and I could see one of the girls openly microwaving the food! It&#8217;s ridiculous! I payed $8 for my tamale pie and i got a pinch of greens for a &#8220;side&#8221;. This place is good for coffee, not for dinner.</p>
