		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ad- I that you are writing here.  Your reviews on Chicago are good, and I am planning on printing out some of these places the next time that I am in town.  

I hope that all is well, and that the grad school process is not to burdening.

Cheers,
Peter]]></description>
