			<p>Due to an extreme case of Cabin Fever, my webmaster and I boarded the first plane we happened upon last weekend and found ourselves in the slightly less chilly part of the country called Chicago. It was maybe five degrees warmer than Minneapolis, but even that felt nice. Luckily my younger sister, who happens to reside there, took pity on our frozen souls and provided us with shelter, company, and sustenance. She even humored my appetite for cafes by introducing me to a pleasant little coffee shop called Dollop, located just north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview_(Chicago)">Wrigleyville</a> (yes, that would be the popular neighborhood surrounding Wrigley Field), and a delicious organic cafe in Roger&#8217;s Park called the Heartland Cafe. </p>
<p><span id="more-29"></span><br clear="both" /></p>
<h3>Dollop</h3>
<div class="shadow"><img src='http://cafeapolis.com/wp-content/2007/02/jusin_dollop.jpg' alt='Justin In Dollop' /></p>
<div class="topleft"></div>
<div class="topright"></div>
<div class="bottomleft"></div>
<div class="bottomright"></div>
</div>
<p>Dollop is actually in Chicago&#8217;s <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1293.html">Uptown neighborhood</a> right next to Lake Michigan. The different neighborhoods that make up Uptown vary quite a bit. One block will be world-weary and worn, the next will be upscale and tidy. Dollop is just a block or two into a neighborhood of the latter sort, and just a few blocks from the lake. I didn&#8217;t get to take any pictures because it was crowded and, quite honestly, being on vacation makes me a little lazy, but you can check out their <a href="http://www.dollopcoffee.com/">website</a> to get a feel for it. The thing that gave this place a nice feel was that there are two rooms to choose from: 1) the sunny front room with the baristas, windows, and friendly noise, and 2) the quieter back &#8220;cellar-like&#8221; room full of students that felt like a cozy den (except near the back window &#8211; drafty!). We spent a good hour there enjoying the coffee and reading the local papers. The baristas were friendly, the space was pleasant, and the neighborhood felt welcoming. It had a slightly more big-city feel than a Minneapolis coffee shop, but of course that&#8217;s expected. And while I noticed more chain coffee shops in Chicago than independent ones, it&#8217;s nice to know that real neighborhood Places still exist. You just have to know where to go (or have a sister who knows).</p>
<h3>Heartland Cafe</h3>
<p>One evening we had dinner in a wonderful little cafe in the Rogers Park neighborhood, which is in the northeastern-most part of Chicago. This neighborhood is also known for its diversity and access to the lake. Just off the red line on a very residential and close-knit street sits the Heartland. It looked very welcoming with its warm glow in the cold winter night. Inside you&#8217;ll find a small hippie &#8220;general store&#8221; featuring earth-friendly items, a cozy bar area, and then a larger almost cafeteria-like restaurant area with much woodwork and plants. Nothing fancy, just comfortable. Same goes for the food; it&#8217;s not gourmet but it is made of delicious simple nutritious ingredients, served alongside tea and coffee. And may I just say that the Heartland makes the most incredible corn bread I have ever tasted? Next time I&#8217;m in Chicago, I&#8217;m taking the train all the way up there just for another taste. In the corner is a small stage which at the time was being set up for music that night. Reading the website you&#8217;ll find that the <a href="http://www.heartlandcafe.com/">Heartland</a> is incredibly involved in the community, providing a meeting place for political events, musical performances, radio shows, and theater. If any cafe could be considered a local neighborhood &#8220;living room&#8221;, this would be it. I was impressed and excited that such places still existed and thrived. Are there any places in Minneapolis that compare?</p>
<h3>ChicaGo</h3>
<p>Chicago is a fantastic city that boasts a user-friendly mass transit system, the <a href="http://www.chicago-l.org/history/index.html">&#8220;L&#8221;</a> (for elevated train), which got us around quite well. We also checked out the <a href="http://www.mcachicago.org/">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> and the gigantic <a href="http://www.artic.edu/">Art Institute</a>. I&#8217;m not only interested in cafes, after all. </p>
<p>Chicago is no Manhattan, of course, but for those who want a large city without having to endure the East Coast it happens to be perfect. The city is diverse, proud, complicated, welcoming, overwhelming, and entertaining. Though my heart belongs to Minneapolis, I consider Chicago to be a very acceptable alternative. I especially enjoyed looking down at all the neighborhoods and architecture from our elevated view as we puttered along on the train. What a fantastic way to spend a cold winter weekend!</p>

	</li>

	<li id="comment-18"><p>so glad you enjoyed it. and yes, next time we will go back to the heartland and explore some other neighborhoods (maybe wrigley and belmont, but more likely the 11 city diner in the south loop or the hipster paradise that is wicker park; then again we could take in a drag show in boystown&#8230;). 😉<br />
ya&#8217;ll come back now, ya hear?</p>

<p>I hope that all is well, and that the grad school process is not to burdening.</p>
