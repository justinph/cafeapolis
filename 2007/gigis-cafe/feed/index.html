		<description><![CDATA[Gigi&#039;s is awful. Not because of the quaint location or the cute, friendly girls that work there, it&#039;s that they microwave their food! My tamale pie was stuck to it&#039;s plate and I could see one of the girls openly microwaving the food! It&#039;s ridiculous! I payed $8 for my tamale pie and i got a pinch of greens for a &quot;side&quot;. This place is good for coffee, not for dinner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live in the neighborhood and used to go into gigi&#039;s regularly and have always enjoyed. Recently however I have been really disappointed with the food. I was told they have had a change in the kitchen and baking staff and it shows. Perhaps they will get it right again, but for now I feel there are better options around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Gigi’s Cafe » Cafeapolis «  &#8220;Generally you will find a slightly older, more professional crowd at Gigi’s. There is no wifi offered and after sitting awhile it occurred to me that this was most likely done on purpose. The biggest difference from most coffee shops I’ve been to is the almost complete lack of students tapping on laptops. One could certainly study here, but only if it involved those old-fashioned dealies known as “books”. No wireless and the downplaying of decor lends itself to the experience. Gigi’s becomes the background upon which more important things happen: enjoying quality food and drink, relaxing and talking with friends, and appreciating a delicious summer evening.&#8221; [...]]]></description>
