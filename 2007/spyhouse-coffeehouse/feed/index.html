		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments, Emma! Even though I said the baristas were &quot;cheeky&quot;, I still like the Spyhouse. In fact, Justin (the man I am going to marry in two weeks) and I met at Spyhouse just over three years ago! It is a good place to meet special people, isn&#039;t it. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am only 11, but love the place.  The decor is relaxing. I have one thing to say for the &quot;Former Barista&quot; I am very good friends with all the Baristas 
including the ones at the new Spyhouse and the Bad Waitress. I think if you are friendly to them they will return the favor. If you get to know them, they are great people. (P.S. if you don&#039;t like them go to the bad waitress and meet Brooke, it doesn&#039;t get much friendlier.)
And Adrienne, are you the former employee? If you are in the mood for chocolate or cream, try the chocolate Eclair&#039;s they are DELISH. Plus their chai is amazing. Hot of Iced. Decaf or not.
I never get the feeling I am bothering them, or that anyone else is either. THEY ARE NOT &quot;CHEEKY&quot;.  I absolutely recommend this place
to everyone. In fact, I met my best friend there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[re: eric james -

although it is important to treat regular customers with respect you must also note that people will not come back if they are not treated nicely the first time (in which case they would not be regulars...obviously). i personally had a wonderful experience my first time in the new hennepin location with a barista who really seemed to enjoy her job. that makes me really want to go back to the coffee shop again. so get off your high horse and stop being that annoying regular who glares at people he doesnt recognize when they walk through the door. you are the type of self-righteous individual which makes me think twice about going into independent coffee shops. i am going to go out on a limb and say that everyone, no matter who you are, enjoys a nice smile and a greeting when they walk in to an establishment...but thats just me. sorry, i had to get that off my chest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to stick up for Spyhouse and say while its true sometimes the baristas are not the UBER HYPER HELLO WELCOME TO CARIBOU types, they certainly treat their regular customers (muah) extremely well and it&#039;s after a while you&#039;ve proven your commitment to their coffeeshop that they&#039;re great people. This might sound at odds with how the market should work (they earn *your* business right?) but consider Spyhouse has a monopoly on the cool coffeeshop in this area of 8,000+ people under the age of 30. So you making yourself feel cool once a month doesn&#039;t exactly mean their long-term survival in the end. 

And I think their baristas are very happy considering for about two years now I&#039;ve seen the same people 9-5pm. 

But dear Christian, the espresso and coffee flavor! It needs a tweak.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been visiting the spyhouse since the day it opened. The coffee has gone steadily down hill. I got a coffee there for the first time in a while the other day. It was one of the worst I&#039;ve had in quite some time. Which means the corpo coffee we have at my office is actually better.

I qualifies as coffee, sure, but honestly it can&#039;t compare to a good cup of coffee that I can get at Bob&#039;s, CRC, or, dare I say, Starbucks.

And the service is kind of crappy, too. Strangely enough, the Bad Waitress, under the same management/ownership right down the street seems to have consistently better service and usually better coffee. I&#039;ll go there before Spyhouse any day of the week.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know of one very nice barista there, but I have to say that 9 times out of 10 you get the feeling you&#039;re being a bit of a bother to them. Hence &quot;surly&quot;, &quot;saucy&quot;, and &quot;pretentious&quot;. Many people I&#039;ve talked to say the same thing. But it&#039;s still a fun place to hang out on occasion, with a good atmosphere - I can ignore cheeky employees. Bad Waitress is a good alternative. I&#039;ll be reviewing them in the future. Thanks for the comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[do you actually enjoy the service there??  everytime i&#039;m in that place the baristas seem snooty and stuck up.  i can understand everyonce in a while being in a bad mood and not prone to idle chit chat.  but everytime??  i have never once seen anyone there serve my coffee with a smile nor make anymore eye-contact then they possibly need to while taking my order and my money.

reasons like those have made me not want to go there anymore.  i believe it is over-rated.  now i just head down the street to the bad waitress where you can get the exact same cup of coffee, but the service is much more friendly and the people even smile without you having to make a joke.]]></description>
