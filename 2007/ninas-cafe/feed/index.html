		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I realize this is somewhat off-topic however I needed to ask.
Does building a well-established blog like yours require a massive amount work?
I am brand new to writing a blog however I do write in my journal every day.
I&#039;d like to start a blog so I can share my experience and views online. Please let me know if you have any kind of suggestions or tips for brand new aspiring blog owners. Appreciate it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great, thorough review, with a good eye for detail. I might take exception to some points, however, such as the &quot;friendly&quot; baristas. During the many times I&#039;ve been to Nina&#039;s, the staff were the definitely the low-point. Sometimes surly, often diffident, I never really felt &quot;at home.&quot; But I could be the exception, not the rule. I do love the bench seating, plethora of outlets, and the bookstore. Definitely worth a look-see if you haven&#039;t been.]]></description>
