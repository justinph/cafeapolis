		<description><![CDATA[The Blue Moon&#039;s own website is:
www.drinkbluemoon.com

And yes, the unnecessary construction work on Lake Street has seriously impacted the businesses.  There are even more empty and for sale spaces now in 2009 than when the article was written.

The Blue Moon is a great place to stop.  I see lots of people there studying and working on their computers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I&#039;m going fishin&#039;in Lake City (Theilman).  But the place in Welch (Troutscream) is really for sale--my friend Deb said so! This is the place to be.
Just fishing, that&#039;s it. Enjoy the wind and the weather.
peace
at all costs,
Cheryl the Bluemoon&#039;s number one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found Blue Moon was cozy. . .for awhile. Then I moved myself down to Dunn Bros down the road because suddenly it became acceptable to have children running around and screaming in Blue Moon on the weekends.
 I don&#039;t count as young and hip, more of a young-ish poor grad student with stuff  who could always use a cup of tea whilst working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right: the Riverview Cafe and the Birchwood Cafe (in Seward) are worthy competitors, though I only mentioned Dunn Bros because they are a chain company. Thanks for reminding me - I&#039;ll get to covering those two wonderful cafes soon. The Birchwood is one of my absolute favorites!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Blue Moon is very cool.  But there&#039;s noteworthy coffee competition in the neighborhood besides the Dunn Bros. For my java buck, the Riverview (at 42nd Ave and 38th St) deserves mention here too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;ve always dug that the Blue Moon is GLBT friendly without making us hetero&#039;s feel out of place.  It&#039;s simply a great one of a kind neighborhood meeting place.  I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re doing this project and helping keep the spirit of the indie coffee shop alive.  It goes so far beyond just a good cappuccino!]]></description>
