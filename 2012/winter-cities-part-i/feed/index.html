		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, we don&#039;t think much about how color can be used in the landscape, especially in winter, and I wonder if it has to do with the tendency of those of us in the upper Midwest to deny the fact we have winter four to five months out of the year. I&#039;ve also seen plain white houses in the winter landscape look very lovely (in Jackson Meadow near Marine-on-St.-Croix, MN, for example) but I think that has to do as much with the repetition of form and color, as well as the pureness of the white - doesn&#039;t work quite as well with off-white, which just looks yellow in the snow (such as my house). Thanks for the comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like Jake, the thought that one could (and they do)use color to just plain put something there to see in winter is rather thought provoking. My thought was as his, we see these colorful images of Cuba and never quite think about them near the Arctic Circle. Heck, maybe its even a safety practice. Park your car a block away in a blinding snow storm... Just know you have to head for the red building you can barely see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hadn&#039;t considered the role of vibrant color in snowy climes (seems to me it&#039;s underutilized in Minnesota). Ironic that these pictures remind me of nowhere so much as the Caribbean. What&#039;s the cultural impulse behind a colorful built environment in the tropics, I wonder?]]></description>
