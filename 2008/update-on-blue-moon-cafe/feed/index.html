		<description><![CDATA[You need a promoter.  I too have the desire to give things away for free.  After all, God is the giver of all good things, and when you are blessed, Lisa, as you are, how can you sell something God has made able for you to provide.  However, we do live in an evil world filled with devils.  

Time limits will limit individual devils, but there are plenty more to take their place.

If you want to survive, you need to make a living.  Completely cutting off those that won&#039;t pay for your hospitality isn&#039;t the anwser.  
The answer is catering to a clientelle that value&#039;s service to God, not service to the devils of the world.  

Set up a place for ne&#039;er do wells and the ne&#039;er do wells will come.

Set up a place to exhibit and exhibiters will come.  Take a bite from the exhibitors.

You need a promoter.

		<description><![CDATA[Sad news. I have many fond memories of Blue Moon. Hope they can work it out. Eject the leechers! Tip your baristas! But do keep wifi simple (for customers and staff).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed, show the non buyers the door.  

If you&#039;re going to hang out all day; tip well, share your table with lot&#039;s of friends and order another drink if your cup is empty.

...oh and did I mention, Tip Well. otherwise its a world full of Applebees and Caribous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t there software that you could use to limit people&#039;s online usage to, say, an hour ... at which point they would have to go to the front desk and ask for another password? 

Just a thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree. Blue Moon&#039;s in my neighborhood and friends &#038; I will plan to meet there this weekend.

On a related note, I&#039;m a librarian with Hennepin County and encourage folks to make use of the free wi-fi at public libraries instead or in addition to taking up real estate at coffee shops. You can sit all day with or without your coffee (even on Sat &#038; Sunday) and laptop.  Limited evening hours on weekends but still a good alternative]]></description>

That said - why aren&#039;t they asking the non-buyers to leave? It&#039;s acceptable practice.]]></description>
